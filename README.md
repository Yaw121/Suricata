### Objective

In this lab activity, I explored more about Suricata alerts and logs, including the general process of rule creation.
The Suricata tool monitors network interfaces and applies rules to the packets that pass through the interface. Suricata determines whether each packet should generate an alert and be dropped, rejected, or allowed to pass through the interface.
Source and destination networks must be specified in the Suricata configuration. Custom rules can be written to specify which traffic should be processed.
I examined a rule and practiced using Suricata to trigger alerts on network traffic. I also analyzed log outputs, such as a fast.log and eve.json file. This helped me understand some of the alerts and logs generated by Suricata.

### Skills Learned

- Create custom rules and run them in Suricata,
- Monitor traffic captured in a packet capture file, and
- Examine the fast.log and eve.json output.

### Tools Used 
- Suricata

### Steps

I run the cmd cat custom.rules which displayed the three components of suricata logs, Action which is the first signature, and in this screenshot is the ### ALERT, The Header, which in the screenshot result,### http $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any
The Action Rule which is ### (msg:"GET on wire"; flow:established,to_server; content:"GET"; http_method; sid:12345; rev:3;)
